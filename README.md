## [My git](git.mangoiv.com)

Due to recent events wrt GitHub, I have decided to leave it for my personal projects that are *not keyboard related* (most of the
keyboard related traffic still happens here). For a summary of why this is the case, please refer to [this post by the software freedom conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/).

I have moved to [my own git](git.mangoiv.com) and I can really recommend you to have a look. Other alternatives to GitHub include 
[codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/).
